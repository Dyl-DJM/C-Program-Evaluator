# C Program Evaluator

This project was written to make the task of evaluating C files automatic. It was done as a student practice work.

It was asked to make a python script using the system calls we studied at that moment to analyse some C files and give them a mark for each of these following points :

- The file compiles
- It makes an executable






## Launch the script

Move to the Correction.py directory.

### 1 - Python command

```bash
python3 Correction.py
```


### 2 - Executable command

You should change the cbang to your own path.

```bash
./Correction.py
```




## Example

You can launch the script with the given archive.
